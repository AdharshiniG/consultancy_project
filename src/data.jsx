        answer:"A “Steel Grade” is a defined chemistry that has been made and processed in a particular way.  (A Standard specifies away of doing something.  It might be a test method, a packaging method, or a delivery protocol.) ASTM Grades meet the exacting standards for specific grades of steel developed by the American Society for Testing and Materials.  The standards include mechanical properties and steel chemistries and specify the testing methods to be used. For some grades, additional steelmaking and thermal processing is also specified.  You can be confident that these steel plates will meet your customers expectations."

        id:2,
        question:"What do Steel Grade Numbers Mean?",

        answer:"Hardwood doors are made from planks of real wood, which makes them vulnerable to warping and cracking over time. Engineered wood doors have a completely different construction. They generally comprise of a solid core around which there are multiple layers of wood, and UV Lacquer and polishing line is used in the process. The end product, therefore, is much more durable than traditional hardwood doors."
